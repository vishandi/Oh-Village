# Oh, Village!

## Orbital Project 
**Proposed level of achievement** : Apollo 11

## Motivation
**Role-playing games (RPG)** in form of card games are getting less and less popular these days. This is because gamers do not consider this type of game as fun as other types of games, such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) like Mobile Legends: Bang Bang or DOTA 2. However, we think this phenomenon is happening because RPG card games currently in the market are not as fun, because companies are putting a lot of their resources on more popular type of games, like MOBA, FPS, or battle royale game. Also, this could happen because RPG card games are more fun to be played offline, with actual cards. Hence, we want to popularize this type of game which was popular in the 80’s, such as Dragons and Dungeon (D&D) game. We tried to use deployment and energy systems for the gameplay, with fair amount of good cards and counters toward each card so that no cards will be too overpowered.

## Aim
We would like to make a RPG card game, called “Oh, Village!” with characters, weapons, spells, and trap cards that could be played using computers that mimics user’s experience of playing with actual cards. We also would like to improve user experience by giving them alternatives in how they stack their in-hand-cards. To increase the playability of this game, we will make the cards as simple as they could be from the design aspect to the functionality aspect so that new players would find it easy to adapt and master the strategy in this game. 

## User Stories
  1.	As a new player, I would like to understand and master the strategy of the game faster.
  2.	As a player, I would like to have a platform to play with my friends.
  3.	As a player, I would like the platform to be adjustable with my likings in term of how to stack my card. 
  4.	As a professional player, I would like to have a platform to play with other game enthusiasts of the community. 

## Scope of Project
The Oh, Village! app will be the main UI to provide the user with the game and multiplayer feature of the game. 

- Features to be completed by mid-June :

  The **main features** of Oh, Village! and the big picture of the gameplay system would be the focus of the implementation.
    - The game should have its structure of menu page and the game itself. 
    -	The cards should have formed including their effects, hit points (HP), and/or functionalities. 
    -	There should be a prototype of the game design and big picture of the gameplay.
    - The first phase of game balancing should be completed.
    
- Features to be completed by mid-July :

  The **extensions and additional features** of Oh, Village! would be implemented during this period of time.
    - The game design (UI/UX) should be refined, and background music (SFX) should be added.
    - There should already be animation of card dealing and deployment.
    - Tutorials and guides towards the game should have been implemented.
    - The online multiplayer version of the game should be added.
    - The balancing and beta-testing of the game should be finished.

## Tech Stack
These following tech stacks would be used in our project :
- Unity
- C# (Visual Studio)
